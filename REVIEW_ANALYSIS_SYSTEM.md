## üõ°Ô∏è Fake Review Detection System

### Multi-Signal Authenticity Analysis

Our system uses **10+ signals** to detect fake reviews:

#### 1. **Text Quality Analysis**
```javascript
Checks for:
- Review length (too short = suspicious)
- Generic marketing phrases ("best product ever")
- Excessive capitals/punctuation (!!!)
- Specific product details (size, color, fit)
- Copy-paste patterns
```

#### 2. **Reviewer Profile Analysis**
```javascript
Checks for:
- Total reviews by user (1 review = suspicious)
- Account age (new account = suspicious)
- Generic names ("Amazon Customer")
- Review frequency patterns
```

#### 3. **Rating-Sentiment Match**
```javascript
Checks for:
- Does 5-star rating match positive words?
- Does 1-star rating match negative words?
- Mismatches are highly suspicious
```

#### 4. **Verified Purchase**
```javascript
Bonus points for:
- "Verified Purchase" badge
- +30 points to authenticity score
```

#### 5. **Helpful Votes**
```javascript
Community validation:
- Many helpful votes = likely genuine
- Zero helpful votes = might be fake
```

#### 6. **Timing Patterns**
```javascript
Checks for:
- Burst of reviews on same day
- Very recent reviews (first-day reviews often incentivized)
```

#### 7. **AI Verification** (Gemini)
```javascript
For borderline cases (score 40-70):
- AI analyzes review authenticity
- Detects subtle patterns humans might miss
- Final verification layer
```

## üîç How It Works

### Step 1: Scrape Reviews
```javascript
// Scrape top 20 reviews from product page
const reviews = await scraperService.scrapeReviews(url, 20);

// Extract:
- Review text
- Rating (1-5)
- Reviewer name
- Review date
- Verified purchase status
- Helpful votes count
```

### Step 2: Analyze Each Review
```javascript
for (const review of reviews) {
  const analysis = await detectFakeReview(review);
  
  // Analysis returns:
  {
    isGenuine: true/false,
    authenticityScore: 75,
    confidence: 'high',
    signals: { /* all signals */ },
    reasons: ['Verified purchase', 'Detailed review', ...]
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Filter & Summarize
```javascript
// Separate genuine from fake
const genuine = reviews.filter(r => r.isGenuine);
const fake = reviews.filter(r => !r.isGenuine);

// Generate insights from genuine reviews only
const insights = await generateReviewInsights(genuine);

// Result:
{
  averageRating: 4.5,
  totalReviews: 15 (out of 20 genuine),
  sentiment: 'positive',
  pros: ['Good quality', 'Fast delivery', ...],
  cons: ['Size runs small', ...]
}
```

### Step 4: Integrate with Buying Insights
```javascript
// AI considers both price AND reviews
const buyingInsights = await aiService.getPriceInsights({
  currentPrice: 25000,
  priceHistory: [...],
  reviewSummary: {
    averageRating: 4.5,
    pros: [...],
    cons: [...]
  }
});

// Result: Deal Score considers reviews!
// High rating (4.5‚òÖ) + good price = Higher deal score
// Low rating (2‚òÖ) + good price = Lower deal score
```
