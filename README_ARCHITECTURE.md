## ✅ Recommendation Summary

| Aspect | Recommendation | Why |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| **Structure** | ✅ Keep current (Vite + Express) | Already perfect for your needs |
| **Deployment** | ✅ Separate (Vercel + Railway) | Best performance, lowest cost |
| **Next.js?** | ❌ Don't rewrite | Wrong tool, 16x more expensive |
| **Together?** | ⚠️ Only as backup | Works but inefficient |

## 📊 Why This Architecture?

### Your App Needs:
✅ Heavy scraping (Playwright)  
✅ Cron jobs (3x/day automated)  
✅ Long tasks (30+ seconds)  
✅ Request queue (persistent state)  
✅ 24/7 availability  

### Separate Deployment Provides:
✅ All above requirements met  
✅ Best performance (CDN + dedicated server)  
✅ Lowest cost ($5/month)  
✅ Easy scaling  
✅ No code changes needed  

### Next.js Would Require:
❌ Complete rewrite  
❌ External services for cron  
❌ Cloud service for Playwright ($50/month)  
❌ Workarounds for everything  
❌ 16x more expensive  

**Verdict:** Current structure is perfect! ✅
