# Gemini API Quota - Quick Fix Guide

## 🚨 Error You're Seeing

```
429 Too Many Requests
Quota exceeded: 50 requests/day (Free Tier)
Model: gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

---

## ⚡ INSTANT FIX (30 Seconds)

### Option 1: Use Higher-Quota Model ✅ RECOMMENDED

**File:** `server/services/aiService.js` (Line 12)

**Change from:**
```javascript
model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"  // 50/day limit ❌
```

**To:**
```javascript
model: "gemini-1.5-flash"  // 1500/day limit ✅
```

**Restart server**
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Restart
npm start
```

**Result:**
- ✅ 30x more quota (1500 vs 50)
- ✅ Still FREE
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No code changes needed

---

## ✅ AUTOMATIC FIX (Already Done!)

### Fallback System Implemented ✅

**Your app now:**
- ✅ Automatically uses **statistical analysis** when AI quota exceeded
- ✅ **No errors** shown to users
- ✅ **Still provides useful insights**
- ✅ **Works perfectly** with or without AI

**What Users See:**
```
Before (without fallback):
❌ Error: "AI analysis unavailable"
❌ Empty insights card
❌ Poor user experience

After (with fallback):
✅ Deal Score: 85/100
✅ Recommendation: "Good time to buy"
✅ Note: "(using statistical analysis)"
✅ Great user experience
```

## 📊 Production Usage Estimate

### With Smart Caching:

```
Users/Day | AI Calls/Day | Free Tier | Status
----------|--------------|-----------|--------
10        | 5-10        | 50        | ✅ Fine
100       | 20-30       | 50        | ✅ Fine
1000      | 100-150     | 50        | ⚠️ Use 1.5-flash (1500)
10000     | 500-800     | 1500      | ⚠️ Enable billing
```

**With fallback:** App works at any scale! ✅
